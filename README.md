# Interactive-mapping-in-Python
This Python file contains different ways to make an interactive map using folium. 
An example with the static map of the recent earthquake-triggered landslides in Roundu, Gilgit-Baltistan, can be seen by clicking on the red marker on the last map in the python file. You can also download and visualize the .html file with a static map in a popup marker.
